# Group Groupless Project
The Software Dev Methods and Tools semester-long project repository for Group Groupless:

Dylan Cole (dylanlcole), Jessica Delaney (jede5031), Rebecca Robb (tabularasa7), and Brian T. Sullivan (SlayerWatcher6)

#Title
GoodReels

#Project Description
The goal of this project is to make a website similar to GoodReads that compiles info about movies / TV shows based on user reviews from sites, and making viewing lists, check to see where videos are available, etc.
Website URL: goodreels.webs.com

#Vision Statement
To offer an easy, accessible and customizable way for people to track, rate and share the movies and shows they love with everyone.

#Motivation
People love sharing the things they enjoy with others. With GoodReels, we want to be able to allow people to create a personal, customizable space where they can rate films and TV series, as well as comment, provide feedback, make viewing diaries, track their progress watching shows on their watch-lists, and share with their friends.  We want people to be able to do this all in one place, so that all the information they add or look for can be found in one convenient location.

#Risks
-The four of us have little / no experience working with one another

-Limited / inter-dispersed knowledge relevant to completing a project of this scale

-Potential lack of resources to handle scope of service

-Varying schedules between group members may make in-person meetings difficult to schedule

#Mitigation to Handle Risks
-The four of us have little / no experience working with one another

         Mitigation: working together, getting to know each other, keeping communication
         
-Limited / inter-dispersed knowledge relevant to completing a project of this scale

         Mitigation: specialization in certain areas and task division based on these specializations for every sprint
         
-Varying schedules between group members may make meetings

       Mitigation:  utilizing calendaring software to see when we can meet and using project management software when we can't
       
-Limited resources

       Mitigation:  utilize as many free resources and intelligent development strategies as possible
